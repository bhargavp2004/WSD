        <package_title>Andman Packages</package_title>
        <package_description> Andaman and Nicobar Islands are one of India’s two island union
            territories in the Bay of Bengal. In late 2018, the Government of India renamed Havelock
            Island as Swaraj Dweep, Neil Island as Shaheed Dweep, and Ross Island as Netaji Subhas
            Chandra Bose Dweep. These islands are well-connected by air to major Indian cities and
            via ships to Kolkata, Visakhapatnam, and Chennai. The main entry point to these islands
            from mainland India, Port Blair, is also their capital city. Tourists prefer visiting
            nearby islands, such as Ross Island, Havelock Island, and Neil Island from Port Blair,
            for which regular ferry services are available. Most of the Andaman tour packages from
            India start from here. Besides Hindi and English, Bengali is the most spoken language in
            these islands. </package_description>
